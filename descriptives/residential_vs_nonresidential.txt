    Conclusion:
    
Don't use residential streets. Almost all residential streets are labeled as not bike designated; however, residential roads are bikable--the issue is that they are not tagged because they are known to be residential.

We have funds for ~ 30k images So we need ~3 images per street. Since some nodes may not have corresponding Street View images, plan to take up to 10 images per road -- halting if we exceed the number we can afford.

Start in Boulder, since it is smaller.
