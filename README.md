# Bike-Designated Street View Image Classifier
In this project, [Evan](https://github.com/RAWRke) and I used OpenStreetMap and Google StreetView API to generate an extensive dataset of 17,270 images of streets, labeled as bike-designated or not. Then, we trained a neural network to classify images. Our neural network outperformed human efforts (other students), correctly classifying 68% of over 3500 unseen images (compared to human-accuracy of 58%).
